However, Seattle’s population grew by 13% in the same period resulting in a per person decline in emissions of 17%. Road transportation has been the largest category of emissions since 1990. Total emissions in this sector increased between 1990 and 2008, however, they have been decreasing since 2008. Advances in vehicle technology, plus a trend towards fewer vehicle miles travelled per person, have led both to decreased absolute emissions from road transportation (down 2% since 2008) and decreased emissions per person (down 13% during this period). Between 2008 and 2014, building-related emissions declined as a result of lower overall building energy use, particularly for residential buildings, due to energy efficiency, more multi-family living, and especially by warmer weather that reduced winter heating needs. This decline, though modest, is more impressive considering Seattle’s population and economy have grown considerably since 1990. On a per resident basis, Seattle’s emissions declined 22% per since 1990 and 6% since 2008. A number of factors led to emissions decreases that counteracted the effect of population and economic growth, especially (as already noted) the decrease in carbon intensity of Seattle City Light’s electricity, more efficient cars and trucks, and building efficiency (including smaller dwellings) and fuel switching. Increased efficiency of air travel also contributed to a decrease in GHG emissions.",662400.0,"(47.6062095°, -122.3320708°)",405.0,2858.0,62472.09,1917.0,42.0,0.78,0.56,643.0,596.0,2.49,2010,1.0,,,80.7

Calculated values for the 2011 greenhouse gas emissions, based on available statistics and modeling, is 3.2 tonnes per capita . Energy use for heating has decreased in 2012, which is probably due to energy efficiency measures and conversions ( from oil to heat pumps). Stockholm has a clear reduction of the energy supply per capita for heating sector. The use of gas in the city decreases. Electricity use is however quite constant. There has been a large reduction in car traffic and a slight increase in the share of light trucks. In the category of passenger cars have petrol car proportion dropped in favor of gas and ethanol cars, but most of all diesel cars. Diesel passenger cars consist increasingly of environmentally rated efficient diesel cars.
